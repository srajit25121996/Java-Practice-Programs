1. The while loop checks the condition at the start before executing the block.
2. With doWhile loop the code block is executed at least once and then the condition is checked.
3. Be careful with the condition, it is easy to end up with endless loop on other words a loop that never ends or to end up with loop that never executes.

[Tip:always check your condition/expression.]
//continue and break statement

1. We can interrupt the the loop by using a continue and/or break statement.
2. With the continue keyword the loop will bypass the part of code block that is below the continue keyword and continue with the next iteration.
3. With the break keyword we can execute the loop depending on the condition that we are checking.
